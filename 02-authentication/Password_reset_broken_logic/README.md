## Steps

### Analyze

As usual, the first step is to analyze the functionality of the lab, in this case, the reset functionality. For this reset the password for `wiener`.

The request for the `forgot-password` feature does not look that much interesting. It contains a few headers that may be interesting, but nothing obvious. The body only contains the username.

It results in an email being sent to the email of wiener:

Clicking on the link allows me to enter a new password for `wiener`:

The corresponding POST request looks much more interesting, as it contains the username:

![POST_change_password_wiener](img/POST_change_password_wiener.png)

I wonder... if I request a new password as `wiener`, intercept this POST and change the username to `carlos`:

![POST_change_password_carlos](img/POST_change_password_carlos.png)

The request goes through as normal. I now try to log in with the credentials I just step, `carlos:password`, and voila:
