This write-up for the lab *Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities* is part of my walk-through series for [PortSwigger's Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

Lab-Link: <https://portswigger.net/web-security/websockets/lab-manipulating-messages-to-exploit-vulnerabilities>  
Difficulty: APPRENTICE  
Python script: Sorry, currently no script

## Lab description

- The lab application supports a live chat feature using [WebSockets](https://portswigger.net/web-security/websockets)
- Chat messages are viewed by an agent in real-time

### Goals

Use a WebSocket message to trigger an `alert()` for the agent.

## Steps

The lab application is a shop website offering chat support. After loading the page, I go straight to the chat feature. So I start annoying the agent:

![chat](img/chat.png)

The message exchange runs via WebSockets, with me sending messages to the server and the server sending back whatever needs to be written in the chat on my side (including a mirror of my own messages):

![messages](img/messages.png)

So I put the message into Repeater and start playing around:

![repeater](img/repeater.png)

In my browser, the messages are embedded into an HTML table:

![html_table](img/html_table.png)

So what happens if I start using HTML tags in  my messages:

![html_in_message](img/html_in_message.png)
![html_in_message_view](img/html_in_message_view.png)

Assuming that the view of the agent is similar, I try running a script via an `<img>` tag

![img_tag_with_script](img/img_tag_with_script.png)

Of course, as the content gets reflected, I also get that popup, confirming that it worked at least on my side:

At the same time, the lab updates to
